W1213 18:13:09.128000 83176 torch/onnx/_internal/exporter/_compat.py:114] Setting ONNX exporter to use operator set version 18 because the requested opset_version 16 is a lower version than we have implementations for. Automatic version conversion will be performed, which may not be successful at converting to the requested version. If version conversion is unsuccessful, the opset version of the exported model will be kept at 18. Please consider setting opset_version >=18 to leverage latest ONNX features
The model version conversion is not supported by the onnxscript version converter and fallback is enabled. The model will be converted using the onnx C API (target version: 16).
Failed to convert the model to the target version 16 using the ONNX C API. The model was not modified
